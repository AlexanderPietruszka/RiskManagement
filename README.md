<h1>Risk Management</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of developing a risk register and conducting a loss-expectancy analysis. These elements aim to simplify the stakeholder decision-making process.

<h2>Project Summary:</h2>
<h3>Collect Data on Current Situation</h3>
The company is currently running into performance issues with the current software in its primary system that services its clients, resulting in a loss of income due to temporary unscheduled system downtime, and wants to change the legacy software they are using. The company is also hoping to implement new upgrades to a secondary sales system. The company wants to determine if changes to these two systems would be effective. The secondary system requires input from both Sales and IT teams. Listed are summarized amounts of primary and secondary systems. <br/>
Income: $45000 monthly gross<br/>
Income lost with software failure: $600, average 4 downtimes in a month<br/>
Current income from the secondary system: $4000 monthly profit<br/>
Projected income of secondary system with changes: $6000 monthly profit
<br/>
<h3>Perform Quantitative Loss-Expectancy Analysis for Current Downtime Problem</h3>
Primary system:<br/>
Single Loss Expectancy (SLE): $600<br/>
Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO): 4 * 12 = 48<br/>
Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE): 600 * 48 = $28800 annual lost income from downtime<br/>
Currently, the company loses about $28800 a year with their current system. This is the value the proposed software update would bring.
<br/>
<h3>Brainstorm Risks</h3>
Potential risks of primary system software changes:
<ul>
  <li>Data loss when transferring to new software</li>
  <li>Poor training leads to poor management of software systems</li>
  <li>Failure when installing software onto existing hardware</li>
  <li>Poor transition to new software leading to client orders not being fulfilled </li>
  <li>No business continuity plan for current process</li>
</ul>
Potential risk of secondary upgrades:
<ul>
  <li>Organizational differences between departments make it hard to conduct changes</li>
  <li>Little coordination between IT and Sales groups</li>
  <li>New sales systems disrupt branding</li>
  <li>New systems don't comply with current organization policies</li>
  <li>Lack of change management process for secondary system</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Create Risk Register to Categorize Risks</h3>
Note: Risk severity is classified 0-9 with 9 being the highest, and risk probability is classified as a percentage chance of occurrence. <br/>
